# Hello React ðŸ™Œ

My first CRA React App.

Here [online](https://hello-react552020.netlify.app/)!

## Content

well... my first CRA React 'App'.

CRA stands for [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). To crate a React app you need to install a lot of tools to let React works properly. Create React App does the job and install all the necessary dependencies and tools you need.

Here some instructions how to do it by yourself, or for the case I forgot how I did it: -[create-react-app official docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)  
-[codecademy step-by-step tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-create-a-react-app)

## To do

- Let the buttons do more fun stuff. Outside of their components. But maybe that's not how components should work.

- Style the component in a way that the box in the center stay always centered. Check this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32378953/keep-the-middle-item-centered-when-side-items-have-different-widths

## Languges

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSX // Is JSX actually a language (on his own)? Nope.

## What's different...

in comparison to the out-of-the-box CRA-App.

- Some styling on the page.
- An eventhandler on the 'Learn React' link (working on it). The function associated with the random number works atm when you realod the page but it's not fired when you just click on the link. In the actual (maybe now previous) vesion you can see a big black 'Hello' followed by a 1 or 2 or 3, that change if you reload the page. That's the random number that should define wich element of the array of links will be chosen.

# Learnings

- How to 'escape' HTML & JavaScript in JSX if you want to show some code snippet on the webpage without letting the compiler reading it as actual code. I used first the tags <pre></pre>, and then <code></code>, cause I was not satisfy how <pre> worked. I tried also with HTML encoder, that would have worked in Javascript but it didn't worked out. /// Question to myself. What is the exact difference between the parse, the compiler, and the interpretere. Start here maybe: https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-does-javascript-really-work-part-1-7681dd54a36d.

# from here...

the contect of the README.md file created by create-react-app follows:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
